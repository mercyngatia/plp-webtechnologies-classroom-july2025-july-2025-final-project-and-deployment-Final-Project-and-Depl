# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

This is my final assignment project for the **Multipage Website** module. It demonstrates the use of **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript** to build, organize, and deploy a responsive, interactive website that is ready for real-world use.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Website

The purpose of this project is to showcase my **skills, projects, and background** in a professional portfolio format. It allows visitors to learn about me, view my past work, and contact me easily.

## 📄 Pages & Structure

The website is structured into **five main pages**:

1. **Home (`index.html`)** – Introduction and hero section  
2. **Skills (`skills.html`)** – Showcasing my technical and soft skills  
3. **About (`about.html`)** – Personal background and professional journey  
4. **Projects (`projects.html`)** – Highlighting selected projects  
5. **Contact (`contact.html`)** – A form to get in touch, with form validation  
6. **Thank You (`thank-you.html`)** – Redirect page after successful form submission  

### Navigation
- All pages share a **consistent header and footer**.  
- The **navbar** includes links to every page and a **mobile toggle menu**.  
- Internal navigation highlights the current section as you scroll.
